    <h1 style="text-align: center; color:orange;">The Kitty Norville Series</h1>

    <h2 style="color: orange;">Plot Summary</h2>
    <p>The Kitty Norville series is urban fantasy focusing on a world where the <strong>supernatural</strong> is real, and is outed on midnight talk radio. Once the main charater, Kitty, admits to being a werewolf on live radio public reaction is mixed. There are those who think is just a publicity stunt, and there are those who believe it is real.</p>
    <p>Kitty became a werewolf in her last year of college. She has been hiding that fact from everyone. As a late night DJ one night she gets bored with playing old rock and roll and starts discussing the supernatural with her listeners. Ratings are through the roof and her new show <em>The Midnight Hour</em> is born.</p>
    <p>The running joke throughout the book is that the main character, whose given name is<del>Catherine</del> <ins>Katherine</ins>, goes by Kitty. At least once in every book someone asks <q>What kind of name is Kitty for a werewolf?‚Äù</q>
    </p>
    <p>The following statement from Kitty sums up her view of the world:</p>
    <blockquote>I think we are here to make the world a better place then we found it. I think we do not always deserve the cards that we are dealt-good or bad. But we are judged by how we play the cards we are dealt. Those of us with a bum deal that makes it harder to do good-we just have to work a little more is all. There is no destiny. There is just muddling through without doing too much damage. ---Kitty Norville </blockquote>

    <p>
        <mark>Kitty and the Midnight Hour</mark>is the first book in the series. It is a good book, and shows a lot of promise for what is to come. I feel that the series really starts to build up steam in the second book <sup>Kitty goes to Washington</sup></p>
